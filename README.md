## üìå Project Overview
The Online Voting System is a secure, web-based ballot platform designed to digitise elections in schools, universities, clubs and small‚Äìto‚Äìmedium organisations.
It eliminates paper ballots, reduces human error, and provides real-time results while guaranteeing that every voter can vote only once.

| **Market Potential** | ‚Ä¢ Ready-to-deploy Software as a Service for institutions that run annual elections (student councils, club committees, company or board-level-decision).                                                                                           |
| **Third-Party APIs** | ‚Ä¢ **Google Sheets API** ‚Äì enables non-technical staff to audit and share live voter data without database access. Chosen because: (a) zero-learning-curve for spreadsheet users, (b) built-in version history & sharing, (c) free tier covers most institutional use-cases. |
